# Underlearner Anonymous: Multi-Granularity Weighted Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Agents
This repository contains the author's implementation in Tensorflow for the paper "Underlearner Anonymous: Multi-Granularity Weighted Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Agents".

# Dependencies
  Python (>=3.5)
  
  tensorflow-gpu==2.5.0
  
  Keras-Preprocessing==1.1.2
  
  torch==1.9.0
  
# Implementation
Here we provide the implementation of a MGW-FL in TensorFlow, along with a specific execution example (on the CIFAR-100 dataset).
mnist_train.py may be used to execute a full training run on MNIST dataset.
